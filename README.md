# Fine-tuning InstaDeep's Nucleotide Transformer Model
This README provides an overview of my work with InstaDeep's Nucleotide Transformer Model, a foundation model trained on 550M nucleotide sequences. I fine-tuned this model to predict whether a given sequence is a promoter or not, and to identify the presence of splice sites.

Project Overview
Model Fine-tuning: Leveraged Google Colab's GPU to fine-tune the Nucleotide Transformer Model following the tutorial provided by InstaDeep.

Promoter Prediction: Fine-tuned the model to predict whether a given sequence is a promoter.

Splice Site Prediction: Further practiced fine-tuning the model to predict the presence of splice sites with a high F1 score of 91%.

Future Work
This project serves as a foundation for further exploration and fine-tuning of the Nucleotide Transformer Model for various genomics applications. Future work may involve fine-tuning the model for other prediction tasks in genomics, improving the model's performance, and integrating the model into larger genomics analysis pipelines.
